Coding Standards
================

Do your best to make your code clear and understandable. 

General Expectations
--------------------

- Add a header in a comment at the top of each file explaining what the file is
  and who wrote it. When you get help on your code from someone else, 
  it is polite to acknowledge that person's help in your header.

- Add a comment (docstring in Python) before each class and function explaining 
  its purpose. 

- It is generally not necessary to add comments before lines of code, though
  this can be an effective place to ask  questions when you are stuck.

- Write meaningful commit messages--these are visible to your colleagues. 


Python
------

[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is the main Python style 
guide. Try to follow it.
