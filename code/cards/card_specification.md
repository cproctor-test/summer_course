How a Card should work
----------------------

- A Card is initialized with an int between 0 and 51. Each int represents a 
  different card in a deck. `Card(0)` will be the 2 of Clubs and `Card(51)` will 
  be the Ace of Spades.The order goes like this:

  2 of Clubs, 2 of Diamonds, 2 of Hearts, 2 of Spades, 3 of Clubs, ... , 
  Ace of Hearts, Ace of Spades

  If a card is initialized with anything other than an int between 0 and 51, 
  a `ValueError` should be raised.

- `card.rank()` should return the appropriate element of Card.ranks 
- `card.short_rank()` should return the appropriate element of Card.short_ranks 
- `card.suit()` should return the appropriate element of Card.suits
- `card.short_suit()` should return the appropriate element of Card.short_suits 
- `card.name()` should return "2 of Clubs", "Jack of Diamonds", etc.
- `card.short_name()` should return "2C", "JD", etc.
- a card's string (the result of the `__str__` method being called)
  should be the same as `card.name()`
- a card's representation (the result of the `__repr__` method being called) should 
  be "<2C>", "<10D>", etc.
- You should be able to compare cards by rank. The 10 of Hearts is greater than
  the 5 of Spades; the 6 of Diamonds is equal to the 6 of Hearts.
